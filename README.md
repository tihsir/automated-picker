An autonomous rover, powered by Arduino, designed to identify and pick up opaque plastic trash.
The base works by the principles of an ultrasound-powered object avoiding rover, connected with a HUSKYLENS AI-camera, to properly identify opaque plastic trash (or anything the user of the HUSKYLENS trains to recognize as Object 1), move towards it, and pick it up with the attached hand (made of several servos).
